what are the operators?
------------------------------------------
some special symbols which are used to do some operations are called operators.

let us see few very common operators like + - * / %. these all are operators used in mathematical process. 
there are 2 main categories of operators
    binary operators
        binary operators works upon 2 value/variable. value or variable upon which operators work are also known as operands 
        like + - / * % 
        for example 
        c = a + b
        c = a - b
        c = a * b
    unary operators
        binary operators works upon 1 value/variable
        for example 
        a = -a;
        a++ 
        --a 

use wise categories of operators 
------------------------------
 arithmetic operators
  it is used to do mathematical operations 
  examples are + - * / %
 relational operators/ comparison 
  it is used to compare variables/value. it always give result in terms true (1) or false(0)
  1 == used to check 2 variable has same value or not  
  2 != used to check 2 variable has different value or not  
  3 <  used to check whether left side variable is less then right side variable or not 
  4 >  used to check whether right side variable is greater then left side variable or not 
  5 <= used to check left side variable is less then or equal to right side variable
  6 >=used to check right side variable is greater then or equal to left side variable
